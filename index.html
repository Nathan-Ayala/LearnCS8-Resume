        <div class="subheading mb-5">History, Administrative Studies, and RussianðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Nathan Ayala, and I am currently a first-year student at the University of California, Riverside, studying history. I am extremely passionate about the subject, with a particular focus on Russian and East European history. I started by being fascinated by the ancient world, but it wasn't until 8th grade when I discovered the Soviet/Cold War era that I truly fell in love. The complex political and social dynamics of the time period continue to captivate me and drive my desire to learn more.

In addition to my major in History, I plan on pursuing a double major in Russian Studies, as I believe that understanding different cultures and languages is crucial in today's globalized world. I am excited to combine my love of history with the opportunity to delve deeper into Russia and Eastern Europe's rich culture and history.
<br><br>

        As the child of immigrants from Mexico, the importance of education in shaping one's future is not lost on me. My parents did not have the opportunity to pursue higher education, and I am determined to make the most of the opportunities available to me. I am committed to building a strong foundation for my future career as a historian by excelling in my studies and seeking out opportunities for research and internships. My ultimate goal is to attend graduate school, earn a Master's degree, and eventually achieve my Ph.D. and become a professor. I believe that history can shape our understanding of the world and our place in it, and I am eager to share my love of the subject with others as a professor.

In recognition of the financial risks associated with pursuing a Ph.D. and the state of the academic job market, I am also completing a minor in Marketing. I believe that the skills I have already started to gain through my studies in history, such as critical thinking, analysis, and research, will be valuable in any field. My proficiency in foreign languages will also be an asset in the business world. 
<br><br>

In addition to my studies, I have also gained valuable customer service and communication skills through my experience working in the fast food industry at Wendy's and Farmer Boys. I firmly believe that working while attending school has numerous benefits. I have learned to interact with customers in a friendly and professional manner and to effectively communicate with my colleagues and supervisors. These skills will be valuable as I continue my studies and pursue my career goals.

I am excited to see where my studies and experiences will take me and am committed to using my passion for history to positively impact the world.        </p>
